MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

This MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of date of the last signature below, between Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices located at 85 Wells Avenue, Newton, MA 02459 (“Karyopharm”) and The Regents of the University of California on behalf of its San Diego Campus with an address of 9500 Gilman Drive MC 0934, La Jolla, CA 92093-0934 (“UCSD Company”). (Karyopharm and Company may be referred to, collectively, in this Agreement as the “Parties”, and, individually, as a “Party”).

1.  Purpose. Karyopharm and UCSD Company wish to discuss a possible business, research, or other relationship pertaining to a specific project or other activities between the Parties related to sharing preclinical data in multiple myeloma and possible future research collaboration (the “Stated Purpose”), and, in connection with such discussions or as part of the resulting research, business, or other relationship, if any, each Party may disclose or make available to the other Party certain information which the disclosing Party desires the other Party treat as confidential.

2.  Definition. “Confidential Information” means all information and materials of a confidential, secret or proprietary nature disclosed by or on behalf of one Party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other Party (the “Receiving Party”), on or after the date of this Agreement regarding the Stated Purpose, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, including, without limitation, information and materials regarding technology, products, product candidates, research and development activities, results, compound designs or structures, manufacturing or other processes or methods, know-how, Trade Secrets, inventions or other intellectual property, the existence or content of licenses, the existence, status or content of licensing or collaboration negotiations, other agreements with third parties, information regarding facilities and financial and other business information, in each case whether or not (i) identified or marked in writing as “confidential” at the time of disclosure; or (ii) appropriately identified as confidential and proprietary at the time of disclosure but later reduced to writing and marked as “confidential” within thirty (30) days of disclosure; or (iii) to the extent marking is not practicable, of a nature that a reasonable person in a relevant field would deem the information to be Disclosing Party’s confidential or proprietary information, given its content and the circumstances of disclosure and including all documents, presentations, information, reports, materials, evaluations and copies to the extent incorporating or generated from any of the foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, documents created by UCSD in the course of a research, that contain UCSD work product, using Confidential Information shall not be consider confidential.   “Trade Secrets” means any Confidential Information that (1) derives value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being generally readily ascertainable by proper means by, third parties and (2) is the subject of reasonable efforts by Disclosing Party to maintain its secrecy. Each Party shall reproduce the other Party’s proprietary rights notices on any such copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original. Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information may also include information obtained by Disclosing Party from its collaborators, customers, suppliers, vendors and other third parties who have entrusted their confidential information to Disclosing Party.

Confidential Information shall not, however, include any information which the Receiving Party can establish by written record: (i) was publicly known and generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party; (ii) becomes publicly known and generally available after disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party through no action or inaction of Receiving Party or any of Receiving Party’s agents or employeesRepresentatives; (iii) was already in possession of Receiving Party or its Representatives, as evidenced by Receiving Party’s or its Representatives contemporaneous records, immediately prior to the time of disclosure to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party; (iv) is obtained by Receiving Party or its Representatives from a third party who has a right to disclose such information free of any obligation of confidentiality and who did not derive the information from owed to Disclosing Party; and (v) is independently developed by Receiving Party or its Representatives without use of, or reference to, information provided by Disclosing Party.

For the avoidance of doubt, specific Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party shall not be deemed to be publicly known, or in Receiving Party's prior possession, merely because such Confidential Information is embraced by more general information which is publicly known or in Receiving Party's prior possession. Likewise, specific Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party by Disclosing Party shall not be deemed to be publicly known merely because other Confidential Information contained in the same document or embodiment becomes publicly known.

3.  Non-Use and Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information. Receiving Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party for any purpose other than the Stated Purpose or as otherwise approved in writing by Disclosing Party. For avoidance of any doubt, the Receiving Party shall not directly or indirectly use Confidential Information of Disclosing Party in the preparation or filing of any patent application. Receiving Party agrees not to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, and not to copy the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information except as is reasonably necessary for the Stated Purpose. Receiving Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party to any third party or to Receiving Party's employees, except (i) as it applies to Karyopharm, to those employees, representatives, agents, or consultants and (ii) as it applies to UCSD, its employees and agents of Receiving Party (collectively, “Representatives”) who have a specific bona fide need to know such information in order to advise Receiving Party for the Stated Purpose and who (a) in the case of Karyopharm, are bound by written obligations of confidentiality and restrictions on use that cover such Confidential Information and are at least as stringent as those set forth in this Agreement, and (b) in the case of  UCSD, are bound by obligations of confidentiality as a condition of their employment. Receiving Party shall be directly and fully responsible and liable for its Representatives’ compliance with this Agreement, and the failure of any of its Representatives to use and protect the Confidential Information in a manner consistent with the Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement may will be considered a breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.

4.  Disclosure Required by Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party to the extent required by applicable law, including pursuant to a subpoena or other court order, provided that Receiving Party gives Disclosing Party, to the extent legally permissible, prompt written notice of such requirement prior to such disclosure and, at Disclosing Party’s cost, reasonably cooperates with Disclosing Party’s efforts to limit the scope of the information to be provided or to obtain an order protecting the information from public disclosure.

5.  Maintenance of Confidentiality. Receiving Party agrees that it shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.        

6.  No Obligation. Disclosing Party may at any time cease to make further disclosure of its Confidential Information, and Receiving Party may refuse to accept further disclosure of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate either Party to proceed with any transaction between them, and each Party reserves the right, in such Party’s sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the Stated Purpose.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such Confidential Information solely for purposes of ensuring compliance with this Agreement and (ii) Receiving Party shall not be obligated to return or destroy automatically created electronic copies stored on system back-up tapes provided that such copies shall remain subject to the provisions of this Agreement and shall only be retained for the period the Receiving Party normally archives its back-up records.   

9.  No Licenses. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights or license to Receiving Party under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of Disclosing Party, nor shall this Agreement or the disclosure of Confidential Information be deemed to grant to Receiving Party any rights or licenses in or to the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

10.  Term.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, the obligations contained in this Agreement shall terminate one (1) year from the date of last signature.
